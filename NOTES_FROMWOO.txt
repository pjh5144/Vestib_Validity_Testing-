

NARRATIVE SECTION:
- Pls edit intro statement to the following: The following narrative was collected during a 60 minute interview with the above patient. Interviewer 
notes may reflect additional injury information ascertained from the patient's intake questionnaire, initial IOP neuro history & exam and relevant AHLTA records.
- Increase the size of the text fields (or autofit to text) for each of 5 items.  These blocks on average are ~15-20 lines.

INJURY TABLE:
- Add the following subtitle for this table: "For Research Purposes Only: Injury Table"
- Please add the following description under the subtitle: "INTERVIEWER:List any qualifying injuries which resulted in a research determination of TBI or
PCE and rank according to severity (where "1" is the most severe injury, also referred to as the "Index Injury").  The full narrative (above) is archived 
for more detailed accounts of each injury.  Please use the space below to BREIFLY describe each qualifying event. ***DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a
clinical diagnosis. The report is only to be used a clinical aid and for research purposes. ***"

- Change the "None" option in the [Mechanism] field to "Other" - Completed
- Remove the "N/A" option from the [LOC] and [AOC/PTA] fields - Completed
- Add [Injury Type] column with options (TBI or PCE)
- Add [TBI Severity] column with options (Mild, Moderate, Severe)
- Add [Pre-Military] column (check box)
- Add [Injury Rank] column numeric only, with the following notation (somewhere): "...with 1  being the most severe, index injury"

- Expand table if possible to eliminate horizontal scrolling
- Make all fields in the table a required field (EXCEPT for the [TBI Severity] field, IF [Injury Type] is "PCE")
- Order of fields (including new fields): [Date], [Pre-Military], [Injury Type], [TBI Severity], [Mechanism], [Description], [LOC], [LOC Duration 
(min)], [AOC/PTA], [AOC/PTA Duration (min)], [Injury Rank], [Notes]

SUMARRY TABLE:
- Change the subtitle to the following: "For Research Purposes Only: Summary Variables"
- Please add the following description under the subtitle: "The following variables were derived via consensus (sections 1 & 2) and self-report (section 3). ***DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a clinical diagnosis. The report is only to
be used a clinical aid and for research purposes. ***"

- [TBI] - autofill to "Yes" or "No" depending on whether or not there are any injuries in the Injury table, where [Injury Type] is "TBI"; If [TBI] = "No",
then grey out the following fields: [TBI Total #], [Index Injury: TBI Severity], [Index Injury: LOC], [Index Injury: LOC Duration (min)], [Index 
Injury: AOC/PTA], [Index Injury: AOC/PTA Duration (min)], [Index Injury:Time  Since Index (most severe) TBI], [Index Injury: Pre-Military]
- [TBI #] - auto sum all injuries with [Injury Type] "TBI" selected; also, please rename to [TBI Total #]
- Pre-fill boxes for [TBI Severity], [LOC], [LOC Duration (min)], [AOC/PTA], [AOC/PTA Duration (min)], [Time Since Index (most severe) TBI], based on the
previously entered injury table data for the #1 ranked injury (via [Injury Rank]) that is classified as a "TBI" (via [Injury Type]); Also, please preface 
each of these labels with "Index Injury:" OR have a subtitle for this section to make it clear that this data is all associated with the "Index Injury", specifically

- Auto-calculate [Index Injury: Time Since Index (most severe) TBI] (formula: [Encounter Date] - [Date] of #1 ranked TBI injury (index injury)); again, 
"Index Injury" is defined as where  ([Injury Type] = "TBI" AND [Injury Rank] = 1)
- Remove [Pre-mil TBI Severity], [Time Since Pre-mil TBI (yrs)], [Pre-mil TBI Mechanism]
- Rename [Pre-Mil TBI] to [Index Injury: Pre-Military], group it with the  o her "Index Injury" fields (see order below), and autofill based on the [Pre-military] status of the index injury in the injury table; specifically,
a "Yes" where ([Injury Type] = "TBI" AND [Injury Rank] = 1 AND [Pre-Military] = 1) and a "No" where ([Injury Type] = "TBI" AND [Injury Rank] = 1 AND [Pre-Military] = 0) - [Other Possible Concussive Events (Y/N)] - autofill to "Yes" or "No" 
depending on whether or not there are any injuries in the Injury table, where [Injury Type] is "PCE" - [PCE Total #] - auto sum all injuries with [Injury Type] "PCE" selected; If "No", then grey out [PCE Total]
- If [Blast Exposure] = "No", then grey out [BE Total Lifetime #], [BE Signif Events #]
- If [Hard Landings] = "No", then grey out [Signif HL #]
- If [Fast Boat (FB) Exposure] = "No", then grey out [FB Total (yrs)], [FB Signif Events #]
- If [Breecher Exposure] = "No", then grey out [Breecher Lifetime Exposure #], [Breecher Signif Events #]; Also, "Breecher" should be corrected to "Breacher"
- If [Martial Arts/Combatives] = "No", then grey out [MA Total (yrs)], [MA Signif Hits #]; also please change [MA Total Signif Hits #] to [MA Total  Signif Events #]
- Order of fields (including updated/new fields): (section 1)  [TBI], [TBI Total #], [Other Possible Concussive Events], [PCE Total #], [Potential Anoxic Event]
(section 2)  [Index Injury: Severity], [Index Injury: Mechanism], [Index Injury: LOC], [Index Injury: LOC Duration (min)], [Index Injury: AOC/PTA], 
[Index Injury: AOC/PTA Duration (min)], [Index Injury: Time Since Injury], [Injury Index: Pre-Military]
(section 3)  [Blast Exposure], [BE Total Lifetime #], [BE Signif Events #],[Breacher Exposure], [Breacher Lifetime Exposure #], [Breacher Signif Events #], [Hard Landings], [Jumps Total #], [Signif HL #], [Fast Boat (FB) 
Exposure], [FB Total (yrs)], [FB Signif Events #], [Martial
Arts/Combatives], [MA Total (yrs)], [MA Signif Hits #]
- If possible, pls add some kind of borders and/or shading to visually  separate these three sub-sections
